# Practical-2

## Practical 2.1

In the `src/Variables.java` file, inside the main method create 4 variables with
the following assignments. Use appropriate types for each of the variables

- name: {Your Name}
- cards: 52
- happy: true
- change: 2.5

### Practical 2.1.1

Extension: In the main method, take your variables and print them to the console

Expected Output:

```
Konrad
52
true
2.5
```

### Practical 2.1.2

Extension: Reassign the `happy` variable to false, and reassign the `change`
variable to 5.1 and print these variables to console

Expected Output:

```
Jordan
52
false
5.1
```

## Practical 2.2

In the `src/Input.java` file complete the main method so that it accepts a line of input from
the keyboard and prints it back to the console. 

*Hint* use s.nextLine()

### Practical 2.2.1

Extension: Modify the main method so that you can input twice and print out to
the console the input from the keyboard

## Practical 2.3

In the `src/Variables` class and in the method `binaryToDecimal`, complete the
 method to convert a String containing a binary number to a decimal and print it to the console.
 
*Hint* use the Integer class

## Practical 2.3.1

Extension: In the `src/Variables` class and in the method `binaryToHex`, complete
 the method to convert a String containing binary number to a hexadecimal and print it to the console.
 
## Practical 2.3.2

Extension: In the `src/Variables` class and in the method `binaryToOctal`, complete
 the method to convert String containing a binary number to an octal and print it to the console.

## Practical 2.4

In the `src/Circle` class main method, write code to print the area and perimeter
 of a circle when given the radius.
 
 *Hint:* Use `Math.pi()`

Area = pi * radius^2
Perimeter = 2 * pi * radius

Expected Output given radius 7.5:

```
Perimeter is = 47.12388980384689                                                                              
Area is = 176.71458676442586
```
