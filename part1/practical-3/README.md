# Practical-3

## Practical 3.1

In the src/Looping class, using the `bands` array, loop through each value
 in the array using a for loop and print each value to the console
 
### Practical 3.1.1

Extension: Using a for each loop, print the contents of the *bools* array, 
 printing each value to the console in turn
 
### Practical 3.1.2

Extension: Using a while loop, print the contents of the *pwr2* array,
 printing each value to the console in turn

## Practical 3.2

Research Task: Using the lecture material, and resources that you have found
online, write a **200** word report in markdown in the **report.md** file about
your understanding of the following topics in Java:

- Variables, creation and assignment
- binary, hexadecimal, and octal number representations
- Looping

This is a formative task, try and be clear and concise in your discussion in the
report.

See [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for
guidance on how to write in markdown.


## Practical 3.3

Create a new class called `Days`. Create a new String array called days and
 populate the array with the days of the week {"Monday","Tuesday",...,"Sunday
 "}. In the main method, print the days of the week to console using a for each loop
 
### Practical 3.3.1

Extension: Create a new array called `Months` and populate the array with the
 names of the months. Print the names of the months to the console using a
  while loop in the main method.
  
### Practical 3.3.2

Extension: Create a new int array called `fibonacci` and populate the array
 with the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence. Print out the values to
  the console. Create a new array called `fibonacciDoubled` and multiply the
   values the values in `fibonacci` by 2 and add them to `fibonacciDoubled`

 more about the Fibonacci Sequence   

## Practical 3.4

Create a new class called `TemperatureConverter`. In the main method write code
 to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The code should
  take an input from the keyboard and then print the converted value to the
   console
 
Conversion Formula: ((Fahrenheit-32)*5)/9 = Celsius
