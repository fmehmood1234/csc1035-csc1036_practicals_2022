# Practical-1

Make sure to create a git repository from the template before you start the practicals.
If you do not do this, then your changes may not be saved

## Practical-1.1

In the file called `HelloWorld`, fill in the main method to print out to the console
your name, 'CSC1035 Programming Portfolio 2', and 'hello, world'.

Expected Output:

```
Konrad Dabrowski
CSC1035 Programming Portfolio 2
hello, world
```

## Practical-1.2

In the method called `addition` print out to the console the result of 100 + 50

Expected Result:

```
150
```

### Practical-1.2.1

Extension: Remove the values 100 and 50. Create two variables `x` and `y` and
assign 100 and 50 to those variables. Create a third variable `z` and assign the
sum of `x` and `y`. Print to the console the value of `z`

### Practical-1.2.2

Extension: In the main method, print out the results of the following operations

- -22 + 3 * 2
- (9/2) % 9
- 2,147,483,646 + -15 / 2
- (-2,147,483,646 + -1000/ 2) * 10

Observe the product of the above operations in Java and figure out why you are
receiving those results. 

Expected Output:

```
-16
4
2147483639
-4980
```
## Practical-1.3

Research Task: Using the lecture material, and resources that you have found
online, write a **200** word report in markdown in the **report.md** file about
your understanding of the following topics in Java:

- Naming Conventions
- Commenting
- Sourcing Material Online
- The compiling process

This is a formative task, try and be clear and concise in your discussion in the
report.

See [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for
guidance on how to write in markdown.

## Practical-1.4

In the main method, print the sum for the addition, multiply, subtract, divide
and remainder of two numbers `x` and `y` where:

```
int x = 250;
int y = 72;
```

Expected Output:

```
322
18000
178
3
34
```

## Practical-1.5

In the method `fancyPrint` complete the method to display the following pattern


```
J       a   v     v  a
J      a a   v   v  a a
J  J  aaaaa   V V  aaaaa
 JJ  a     a   V  a     a
```

*Hint: Nothing too fancy is expected here. System.out.println is enough*

### Practical - 1.5.1

Extension: In the method fancyPrint extend the method to display the following
pattern

```
   C    S   C     1  0   3   5 
   CS   C    10   35
C C CSC     103   5
 CS    C    1 0     3     5

```
